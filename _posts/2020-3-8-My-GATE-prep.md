Continuing from Part 1,

## What test series did I use? 

I had given very few tests in my attempt in 2019 and I knew that was a weakness of mine. So in order to fix that, I bought multiple test series this time around. I had - Testbook, Gatebook, Applied Course and Made Easy. 

If I had to rank them in order of preference, it would be: AppliedCourse = GATEBOOK > Made Easy > Testbook.

1. GATEBOOK : It helped me a lot to stay on schedule because they were offering rewards to all students who were taking the test as per their schedule. So that provided me an incentive to do things in time. The questions were mostly from university assignments from various universities, as well as questions from textbooks. After every test, I used to Google the questions to find out where they had been asked from and then, try to solve the entire assignment from its original source. This is how I built my list of bookmarks too, as I used to save all the assignments from which questions had been asked. Sometimes GATEBOOK asked questions which were higher than what was required for GATE, but ultimately, it helped strengthen my concepts too. The only drawback I faced was that the results weren't available immediately and I usually had to wait 4-5 days, just to get the answers and the marks that I had scored. Hopefully, they shall fix it this year.

2: AppliedCourse: They had a lot of new questions, and other questions were a variation of what was usually present in textbooks. Their customer service is very prompt and any doubts I had in the test series questions were usually resolved within a couple of hours. Same as GATEBOOK, some questions which were present 



You can find the list of all the tests that I had taken, along with the marks I scored in them [here](https://www.evernote.com/l/AcOiSw104kdOvqS8iWo6Trf1g0sR4kyqV6s). 

I share this not because I want to brag (there's nothing bragworthy in there anyway) but because when I used to score low in tests, I used to be devastated and then feelings of doubt, anxiety would creep in - that whether I'd be able to clear this year, whether I was not good enough for GATE etc etc. I used to feel these are the same marks I would score in my final exam too and used to look for sources of hope - stories of people who had scored shit in mock tests and did well in the final exam.

During those times, I also used to call my lovely friend Kartavya (who scored AIR 45 in GATE 2019 and joined IIT Bombay) and used to talk to him about how his test scores were when he was preparing and seek motivation from him. He used to tell me how his scores would suck at times too, and that'd give me hope that I can do it too. 

Point being, these test scores can serve as a reference to people who might want to know what people who did well in GATE used to score in their mock tests.

Here are some pretty graphs too - these are the marks that I scored in full length tests of various test series, arranged in chronological order. I started giving full length tests from December 1 onwards.
