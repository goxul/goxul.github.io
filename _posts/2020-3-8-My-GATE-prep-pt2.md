Continuing from Part 1,

## What test series did I use? 

I had given very few tests in my attempt in 2019 and I knew that was a weakness of mine. So in order to fix that, I bought multiple test series this time around. I had - Testbook, Gatebook, Applied Course and Made Easy. 

If I had to rank them in order of preference, it would be: AppliedCourse = GATEBOOK > Made Easy > Testbook.

1. GATEBOOK : It helped me a lot to stay on schedule because they were offering rewards to all students who were taking the test as per their schedule. So that provided me an incentive to do things in time. The questions were mostly from university assignments from various universities, as well as questions from textbooks. After every test, I used to Google the questions to find out where they had been asked from and then, try to solve the entire assignment from its original source. This is how I built my list of bookmarks too, as I used to save all the assignments from which questions had been asked. Sometimes GATEBOOK asked questions which were higher than what was required for GATE, but ultimately, it helped strengthen my concepts too. The only drawback I faced was that the results weren't available immediately and I usually had to wait 4-5 days, just to get the answers and the marks that I had scored. Hopefully, they shall fix it this year.

2. AppliedCourse: They had a lot of new questions, and other questions were a variation of what was usually present in textbooks. Their customer service is very prompt and any doubts I had in the test series questions were usually resolved within a couple of hours. Same as GATEBOOK, some questions which were present which were above GATE level. But if you ignore them, most questions were of good quality, with very few errors here and there.

3. Made Easy: I won't say much about this, as there's enough about this online. I mainly used it to get a sense of competition.

4. TestBook: Most questions were easy, and variations of previous year questions. Mostly used it to practice avoiding silly mistakes.


You can also find the list of all the tests that I had taken, along with the marks I scored in them [here](https://www.evernote.com/l/AcOiSw104kdOvqS8iWo6Trf1g0sR4kyqV6s). 

I share this not because I want to brag (there's nothing bragworthy in there anyway) but because when I used to score low in tests, I used to be devastated and then feelings of doubt, anxiety would creep in - that whether I'd be able to clear this year, whether I was not good enough for GATE etc etc. I used to feel these are the same marks I would score in my final exam too and used to look for sources of hope - stories of people who had scored shit in mock tests and did well in the final exam.

During those times, I also used to call my lovely friend Kartavya (who scored AIR 45 in GATE 2019 and joined IIT Bombay) and used to talk to him about how his test scores were when he was preparing and seek motivation from him. He used to tell me how his scores would suck at times too, and that'd give me hope that I can do it too. 

Point being, these test scores can serve as a reference to people who might want to know what people who did well in GATE used to score in their mock tests.

Here are some pretty graphs too - these are the marks that I scored in full length tests of various test series, arranged in chronological order. I started giving full length tests from December 1 onwards.

## Other than test series, where did I solve problems from?

As mentioned already, I used to solve problems from assignments, textbooks and exams etc.

On top of this, one excellent way to improve your concepts is to **use GateOverflow website efficiently.** As of now, GateOverflow has over 50,000 questions asked by users, across all subjects. Each subject has at least 2000 questions. It also has a feature where you can search questions by Tags and I made use of that extensively.

For example, I sucked at SQL and still do. For the love of my life, I could never do well in SQL problems. So what I did was, I went to GateOverflow and searched questions which had the SQL tag. There were around total 600 questions, only from SQL and I sat down and solved over 200 problems in one day. This helped me get better at SQL. You could replace SQL with any other tag - cache memory, normalisation, regular languages etc and there will be enough questions on GateOverflow. They are an excellent resource and one should definitely consider solving questions from there. 

I was also part of a bunch of Facebook and Telegram groups for problems where people used to post doubts, but their effect was negligible, if I am being honest.
